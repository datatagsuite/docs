Introduction
============

This Sphinx extension allows authors to embed a `JSON Schema <http://json-schema.org>`_ in their documentation.

It arose out of a personal itch and implements what I needed.
Some features of JSON Schema are (not yet) implemented.
Also I can imagine that other display layouts are desired.

I only tested it for use with the `draft 4 <http://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#draft-4>`_ specification of JSON Schema.
I was pleasantly surprised to find that the software is useful to others as well.
Therefore it made sense to document intended use.
