First Steps with DATS
#####################

This document gives an overview of the DATS components from a practical perspective, i.e. considering how DATS is used to describe a specific dataset considering a set of questions that determine the dataset provenance.

*Who* produced the dataset:
-----------------------------

DATS records the *Person* (s) and *Organization* (s) associated with the dataset.
In addition, it supports documenting their roles (e.g. creator, curator, developer, funder, principal investigator)


*When* was the data produced:
-------------------------------

DATS records key *Date*(s) about the *Dataset*.

Each *Date* can specify its type, related to the event related to the key date (e.g. creation, update, validation, verification, deprecation of the dataset).

This mechanism of providing a generic *Date* indicating its type allows for extensions to new types of dates, which may be required in specific scenarios.


*What* is the dataset about:
--------------------------
DATS records the nature of information available in a dataset through the data type object.


*Why* was the data produced:
----------------------------
DATS supports to document the purpose, objective or hypothesis that gave origin to the dataset.


*Where* and *How* the dataset can be accessed:
----------------------------------------------
