Welcome to bioCADDIE DATS's documentation
=========================================

Introduction:
-------------

DATS, which stands for DAta Tag Suite, is a data description model designed and produced to describe datasets being ingested in `DataMed <http://datamed.org>`_, a prototype for data discovery developed as part of the `NIH Big Data 2 Knowledge <https://datascience.nih.gov/bd2k>`_ `bioCADDIE project <http://biocaddie.org/>`_.

For more information about the objectives of the bioCADDIE project, please have a look at the `bioCADDIE White Paper <https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1362572.v1>`_.
For more information about DataMed, please check the DataMed pre-print available in `bioarxiv <https://doi.org/10.1101/094888>`_.
For more information about DATS, please check the DATS pre-print available in `bioarxiv <https://doi.org/10.1101/103143>`_.

This documentation describes the DATS model and how to use it. More details about how DATS was designed and how it relates to other models can be found in the aforementioned documents as well as in the `documents accompanying each of the releases <https://github.com/biocaddie/WG3-MetadataSpecifications/tree/master/doc>`_.
